# 🩺 REMIRE (REhabilitation in MIxed REality)

## 📖 Overview
REMIRE is a **Mixed Reality platform** designed to support upper-limb rehabilitation for stroke patients by combining real-world interactions with virtual tasks. It builds on the original REVIRE system but transitions from fully virtual environments to mixed reality, enabling users to perform tasks directly on physical surfaces like tables.

By using advanced hand tracking and real-world surface detection, REMIRE creates a more **intuitive**, **realistic**, and **engaging** rehabilitation experience. Developed for the **Meta Quest 3** headset, it supports both clinical and home-based therapy scenarios.

This project was developed as part of my **bachelor thesis** at the University of Vienna in collaboration with the Research Group Neuroinformatics.

This video showcases:
- Mixed reality environment setup
- Scene understanding and table detection
- Hand tracking and natural object manipulation
- Adaptive difficulty based on user reach

## 🎮 Key Features
✅ **Mixed Reality Environment**
- Anchors virtual rehabilitation tasks to real tables using Meta’s Passthrough and Scene Understanding APIs.

✅ **Adaptive Task Calibration**
- Automatically calibrates tasks to match the user's reach and table size.

✅ **Advanced Hand Tracking**
- Full skeletal hand tracking using Meta XR Hands API.
- Natural interaction with UI and objects (pinch-to-select, grab, release).

✅ **Modular Task System**
- Unified architecture for easy expansion of rehabilitation exercises.
- Tasks adapt dynamically to different levels of difficulty and user needs.

✅ **Optimized for Performance**
- Reduced polygon counts of key 3D models for smooth rendering on Meta Quest 3.
- Refactored architecture improves scalability and maintainability.

✅ **User-Centered Design**
- UI follows user movement without being obtrusive.
- Feedback mechanisms for calibration and task progression.

## 📝 What I Learned
- Designing and implementing a modular architecture for mixed reality apps.
- Optimizing hand-object interactions with custom grab rules.
- Integrating Meta XR SDK for advanced hand tracking and scene understanding.
- Refactoring legacy VR codebases (REVIRE) for MR scalability.
- Balancing performance and visual fidelity on standalone XR hardware.

## 🏥 Project Context
This project was developed as my **bachelor thesis** at the University of Vienna under the supervision of **Univ.-Prof. Moritz Grosse-Wentrup**. It extends the work on REVIRE (VR rehabilitation) into the mixed reality domain using modern hardware and software tools.

The goal was to demonstrate how mixed reality can enhance motor rehabilitation for stroke patients by providing a more natural and user-friendly training environment.
